## Predicting Customer Churn for a DTH Industry

### 1.1 Industry Scenario

DTH stands for Direct-To-Home. This system allows users to have a personal dish antenna, much smaller in size, that receives transmissions directly from a satellite, hence the term "direct to home" service. DTH provides flexibility for customers to move from one part of the city/country to another without relying on local cable operators.

The combined operating revenue of four private direct-to-home (DTH) companies in India—Tata Play, Bharti Telemedia, Dish TV, and Sun Direct—declined nearly 10% in FY23 to Rs 11,072 crore, compared to Rs 12,284 crore the previous fiscal year. The four DTH companies incurred a cumulative net loss of Rs 2,143 crore, with Dish TV posting the biggest loss of Rs 1,684 crore. *(Source: Economic Times)*

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop a customer churn prediction model for a DTH company and provide business recommendations to maximize customer retention and understand the critical causes for customer churn.
